# TheMaze
A simple text-based game.

## Installation

This project is not completed so to run the project you will ned to download the entirety of the contents and have ```Java 8.0``` installed on your machine.

## Usage

Currently the maze layout is hardcoded into the program. However, there is a copy of this layout saved as a JSON file and the program will be changed to ultimately read from that file. Eventually this will allow for custom maze designs to be created by users. It can only be run from an IDE or the console as it stands.
